# fanuc-driver
  
This solution is built on top of Fanuc Focas libraries for interfacing with Fanuc controllers and publishing data to an MQTT broker or another target.

The primary goal of this solution is to maintain the machine data in its native source format with slight transformations to make it more human readable at the target.  The intention behind this approach is to allow the developer to reference original Focas API documentation further downstream to aid in their transformation and translation efforts.   

## MQTT Topic Structure - Suggested

```
fanuc/{machine-id}/{observation-name}
```

```
fanuc/{machine-id}/{observation-name}/{controller-execution-path-number}
```

```
fanuc/{machine-id}/{observation-name}/{controller-execution-path-number}/{machine-axis-name}
```

```
fanuc/{machine-id}/PING
```

## MQTT Payload Structure - Suggested

Data deltas are published to MQTT broker as retained messages.  This means that any newly connected client will only receive the latest data for each observation.

`cnc_sysinfo` example.

Native source:

```
{
  "addinfo": 1090,
  "max_axis": 32,
  "cnc_type": [
    " ",
    "0"
  ],
  "mt_type": [
    " ",
    "M"
  ],
  "series": [
    "D",
    "4",
    "F",
    "1"
  ],
  "version": [
    "3",
    "0",
    ".",
    "0"
  ],
  "axes": [
    "0",
    "3"
  ]
}
```

After transformation:

```
{
  "addinfo": 1090,
  "max_axis": 32,
  "cnc_type": " 0",
  "mt_type": " M",
  "series": "D4F1",
  "version": "30.0",
  "axes": "03"
}
```

Full published payload:

```
fanuc/sim/sys_info
```

```
{
  "observation": {
    "time": 1620485344410,
    "machine": "sim",
    "name": "sys_info",
    "marker": {}
  },
  "source": {
    "method": "cnc_sysinfo",
    "data": {}
  },
  "delta": {
    "time": "00:00:01.4453544",
    "data": {
      "max_axis": 32,
      "cnc_type": " 0",
      "mt_type": " M",
      "series": "D4F1",
      "version": "30.0",
      "axes": "03"
    }
  }
}
```
